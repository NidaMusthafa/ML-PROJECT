# CO2 Emission Prediction 

### AIM: 
Prediction of CO2 Emission of cars using regression Analysis. 
### TYPE: 
MULTIVARIATE, REGRESSION

### ABOUT THE DATASET 
This dataset contains the co2 emission of different types of cars.The independent feature variables are VOLUME and WEIGHT.This data set can predict the target variable y using linear regression in the most easy way.I have predicted the coefficients and new data prediction which can help you find an alternative target value using this regression model.
